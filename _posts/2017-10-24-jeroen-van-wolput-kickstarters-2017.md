**The first day of a journey will always be remembered. On august 1st over 40 open minded and enthusiastic kickstarters embarked on a journey into the unknown. A journey filled with mountains to climb and rivers to cross. The big kickstarter group sprouted a team of 6 dedicated travelers with as destination the N-Core unit. As we travelled along we filled our bags with knowledge and experience guided by our coaches and managers. After almost 2 months we reached our destination, changed our clothes and re-embarked on a new development journey.**

### 1. First impressions

We’ve all heard the phrase, “you never get a second chance to make a first impression”. Never is that more true than on an employee’s first day on the job. Nonetheless our first day started with a warm welcome at the Ordina headquarters. All 43 kickstarters gathered in the lounge where we met and had a drink.

After chitchatting around with some kickstarters, Ordina gave us a pleasant tour around the building. A brief explanation of every floor and the utilization of it was given by our mentors. We even had a look into our CEOs office and a chance to talk to him! The fun didn’t stop here, briskly after our tour we were presented with a brand new car key and laptop! As everybody took the car keys we walked outside to take a look at our brand new cars! The atmosphere was really enjoyable and everybody was delighted. Later on we had some food and enjoyed the company of our awesome colleagues.

The Ordina building, people and atmosphere made everyone congenial, this resulted in a wonderful impression!

### 2. Set-up

There is no room for amateurism in Ordina. Instructors had to be on top of their courses and no less than a senior consultant was accepted to guide us through the path of knowledge. We took a dive deep into many topics, including, but not limited to, C#, ASP.NET, Databases, XAML, Angular, Git, Xamarin, etc. Next to technical skills, soft skills cannot be ignored as a consultant. Not only did we receive fully fledged out communication trainings, tips and tricks were scattered around every single training where every instructor could convey their own insight to us.

The sheer volume of the training in a timespan of merely 2 months meant that the we could not afford to go slow. Every day, multiple topics were discussed and practiced on. Almost every day we had the possibility to check our progress with a test where most returned with a positive result.

While the tempo was high and the courses plenty, the ambiance was not sacrificed at all. Having a good dynamic within the group, our instructors did not fail to entertain. While learning was the primary goal, having fun was most certainly second.

* OOP/C#/Visual Studio

### 4. Group
As mentioned before, having fun was just as important as work! We are facing each other 8 hours a day. So team spirit is a big thing. Since the first day we met there was a connection. We laughed and told some interesting stories about ourselves on our first day at Ordina. 
Through the studies, we helped each other out and nobody was left behind. Nobody minded to give some extra explanation after the hours or to repeat the same thing a million times. To give a conclusion about the group we can give you a few characteristics about our group. We love to have fun, love to life and love to program.

### 5. Conclusion

With an open mind we started our Kickstarter training. In this training of several weeks we find our way at Ordina and learned a lot of new things or had a great repetition in several topics as listed above. At Ordina there is an excellent atmosphere to work.
Afterwards we can say that the Kickstarter training was a good start on our new/first job and we can recommend the training to other developers who would like to have a new/first challenge.
